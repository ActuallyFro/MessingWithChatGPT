The following SPA is an dynamic Eisenhower Matrix. It adds/removes cards, has movable cards to other quadrants, and the Card body is supposed to allow a textarea editor which renders as HTML.

It has 3 source files:
```html
``` 

```css
```

```javascript
```

Issue: the example entry in the HTML can be placed in the card correctly, hidden/viewed correctly, and the text area successfully renders as HTML. However, for existing HTML that is "re-edited" all of the HTML tags are removed, and they should remain.

Provide a fix.
