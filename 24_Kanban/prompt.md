The following SPA aims to implements a kanban board with the following requirements:
1. At leverages localstorage for saving
2. It can be exported or imported as a JSON file [completed]
3. It can have expandable and re-labelable buckets (or swim lanes)
4. A task can be added to any given swim lane
5. A task can be dragged and dropped to any bucket
6. Tasks when double click can be edited.
7. Buckets can be reordered left to right and when double clicked can be relabeled

It has 3 source files:
```html
``` 

```css
```

```javascript
```

Issue: LocalStorage needs to be clearable.

Provide: edits to the code that adds "Reset LocalStorage" button.

Issue: a Kanban board is needed, but MOST of the features are already implemented in this Eisenhower Matrix.

Provide modified code  to create a Kanban board. Replace the quadrants to have expandable and re-label-able buckets (or swim lanes). Also, the swim-lanes should have '<' and '>' symbols, left of the existing '+' symbol to allow reordering of the swim-lanes.
